# Git Commit Message Writer

## Format

```
type(scope): short description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Allowed types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build

## Instructions

### Step 1: Get the diff

```bash
git diff --staged
```

If nothing is staged:

```bash
git diff HEAD
```

### Step 2: Analyze the changes

Look for:

- What files changed and what category they belong to
- Whether this adds new functionality (feat), fixes a bug (fix), or updates docs/config/tests
- The scope: which module, component, or area is affected

### Step 3: Write the message

- Keep the subject line under 72 characters
- Use imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature"
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Add a body if the change needs more context than the subject allows

### Quality check

- [ ] Type is one of the allowed types
- [ ] Subject line is under 72 characters
- [ ] Imperative mood is used
- [ ] Scope is specific enough to be useful
